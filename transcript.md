# **Welcome and Opening Words**

*Revd Fi Iddon*

Well done, good servant and welcome home.

Good afternoon, and thank you so very much for being here today, as we come to give thanks for the life of our dear friend Mike, whose wise, prayerful, servant-hearted, and generous legacy is almost incalculable. 

My name's Fi, I'm associate vicar here at Trinity Churches, and I'll be leading today's service along with many colleagues and friends. And so on behalf of Judith, Neal, Louise, Tim, Nathan, Freya and the wider family, welcome and thank you very much for being here. 

And thank you as well for those many people who we know are worshipping with us online and who are able to enter into the spirit of remembrance across the airwaves. We're grateful that you are here. Thank you for being part of today. 

Friends, yesterday afternoon we received Mike's body into church where his coffin rested overnight with these words. For God so loved the world that He sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, that whoever believes in Him shall not die, but will have eternal life. And this is a service of thanksgiving both for Mike's life and for the hope that he had, and that we can all have, that death is not the end because of Jesus. Earlier this morning, the close family committed Mike's body to be cremated in a short service, and we committed him to his Lord and Saviour in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life. 

We meet with that hope here as the song that led us in reminded us. And in words and readings, in songs and hymns and prayers, you will find that hope expressed today. So later on in this service, we will try to do our best to describe the impact that Mike had in so many ways. 

This very full church is testament to that, isn't it? Mike was inspirational. But of course, above all else, Mike was a husband, a dad, a father-in-law, a granddad, a brother, a brother-in-law, an uncle, as well as being our friend. 

And so we've come to surround you, dear family, with our love. We've come with sadness at Mike's death, with huge thankfulness for his life, and unswerving hope that we will see him again because of Jesus. 

So let me pray as we begin our service. A verse highlighted in Mike's very well-used Bible says this: “This is love, not that we love God but that he loved us so much that you sent Jesus. That because of his love and triumph over death we can be sure that death is not the end.”

Thank you for loving Mike. Thank you for the many ways in which he reflected that love to each of us here and we pray that in this service we will each know more of the hope that Mike had in knowing you. In Jesus name, we pray.

Well in a moment I'll invite you to stand if you're able to comfortably do so as we sing our first hymn togethe. Judith’s instructions are that we give everything today some serious welly, so we're going to sing these words together. Let's stand and sing “In Christ Alone”. 
<br /><br />

# **Hymn: In Christ Alone**
<br /><br />

*Revd Fi Iddon*  
Please do take a seat. Thank you. We'll be hearing much about Mike's life today from so many people, but it's only right that we hear first from his family, so on behalf of the family here are Neal and Louise. 
<br /><br />

# **Mike's timeline**

*Read by Neal Haddaway*  
Dad was born on the 12th of May 1949 in Islington, London, the eldest child of Reg and Betty Hadaway. Along with brother David, three years younger, sister Kim, seven years younger and Jan, twelve years younger, he enjoyed a very happy childhood. 

At that time the family were living in Ilford, and from age 11 Dad attended Beale Grammar School. His family were not church goers and Dad's church attendance began as a member of the scout group on church parades. 

Reg worked for the post office and when Dad was in the sixth form, because of a promotion, the family relocated to Bexley, in Kent, and it was there that Dad joined St James's Church, making many good and lifelong friends in the youth group. 

In 1968 he began a degree in physics at Brunel University where he met Mum, the only girl in the year group. They became engaged in 1972 and married at St Andrews Bebbington, Judith's home church, on the 10th of August 1973\. 

Following graduation in 1972 Dad had started a job as medical physicist attached to the X-ray department of the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopedic Hospital in Gobowen. Mum and Dad lived in North Wales and Mum taught physics at Oswestry Boys High School. 

After the arrival of Louise in 1979 they moved to Shrewsbury the year later to Woodfield Avenue, where they've lived for 45 years, and it was then that they joined Holy Trinity Meole Brace.

In 1982 I was born. 
<br /><br />

*Read by Louise Vaughan*  
Dad continued to work at the Orthopaedic as medical physics changed and developed with the introduction of CT, MRI and nuclear medicine, all overseen by Dad. He retired in June 2013 but continued his association with the hospital through the League of Friends. 

Along with his various roles at church and with Shrewsbury Food Hub, Mum and Dad enjoyed retirement with some wonderful holidays around the world where Dad was able to indulge his hobby of photography. That was when he could be dragged away from his other great love, his garden. 

Having enjoyed a wonderful retirement up to that point, Mum and Dad were both diagnosed with cancer in May 2024\. Dad supported Mum through her surgery whilst receiving unpleasant but effective medication for his prostate cancer until in May this year. 

He was diagnosed with an unrelated oesophageal cancer. The symptoms of this were cruel, drastically reducing what he was able to eat and consequently his energy levels, but he bore this with his usual grace and fortitude. 

He had just started his second cycle of chemotherapy when side effects caused him to become dehydrated. He was admitted to the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital for rehydration and it was there he died a few days later of a catastrophic bleed at the site of the tumour. 

It was unsurvivable and could not have been foreseen. 

God called him home on the 25th of August.

# **Tribute by Neal Haddaway**  
In the Japanese art of Kintsugi, broken pottery is delicately mended, painting the joins with gold highlights, emphasising the beauty in the imperfection, stronger for the tender and reverent reconstruction. 

In 2019 my life fell apart during a burnout, depression and divorce. I moved back home to live with Mum and Dad, with a dog and a camper van, for three months while I put the pieces of my life back together. 

During that time, I had the immense privilege of building a deep friendship with dad as an adult. As time went on I discovered Dad's application of physics in his hugs. When he hugged me he would lean back ever so slightly, pulling my centre of mass towards him. He became a *fulcrum* in physics terms. I had no choice but to give in to the hug. He felt so safe and I miss his hugs. Like a good researcher I googled the definition for fulcrum. It's not just a leverage point, it also means “something that plays a central or essential role in an activity, event or situation”. That's my dad, absolutely essential to my life. 

I am who I am today, not only because of the loving, nurturing childhood that Mum and Dad gifted me and Louise. I'm also fundamentally shaped by their love and support as my broken pieces were put back together. Dad is gilded into my most beautiful imperfections. 

As we all put ourselves back together, shattered from Dad's loss, he's given us an opportunity to blend gold into our pain, forged in his memory by the love of those around and above us. 
<br /><br />

# **Tribute by Louise Vaughan**  
Being brought up by two physicists is somewhat of a niche childhood experience. Including trips to open days at nuclear power stations and dinner conversations on the question of whether planes really could fly backwards and why. 

The challenge really hit when it came to learning a foreign language and the lesson entitled talking about parents' occupations. I don't think Neal or I ever actually worked out what it was that our dad got up to when he drove off in his little blue mini up the A5 every day. 

There were stories of trips to the butcher shop for a leg of lamb (or was it pork) to calibrate the scanning equipment. And one day, left alone in his office, I was convinced I saw an order for kryptonite on his desk, or maybe that was just my vivid imagination. 

In the end, in exasperation, I remember sitting in my French oral exam and offering “Mon pere travail dans l'opital avec les rayons-X”, to which my teacher, no better able to verify the truth of my answer, replied, “C'est très dangerous, n'est pas?\!”   
   
He may not have actually had a highly dangerous occupation or been the arch-villain to Superman, but I definitely think my dad had special powers, like music. It's a little-known fact that my dad was a recorder virtuoso. He taught me to play when I was about seven, but then a couple of years later, when I had lessons at school, I made two shocking discoveries. Firstly, that the note you were supposed to play was shown by the round dot, not the end of the stem, and that my dad had just been reading a page ahead in our beginner's book. 

But my dad's real superpower was encouragement. He arranged music lessons for Neal and me, came to concerts, encouraged us to practice, and the legacy is a family where music runs through not just us, but our children and their friends, and has become a creative gift we can use in worship of our God. 

And it wasn't just music. My dad championed us in everything we did. There's a little school on Brick Lane in the east end of London, where my dad was a familiar figure to the parents and teachers, fairly early on, after we'd set up a PTA there, about half an hour into our Christmas fair, Santa, aka my husband Tim, appeared in his civvies, having apparently abandoned his grotto. It's okay, he said, I was getting totally overheated in that costume, so your dad offered to take over. That was just what my dad did. 

My dad was also in possession of a sonic screwdriver, not the actual Doctor Who sonic screwdriver, which gets the time lord out of any scrape he finds himself in, but my dad possessed a garage shed and loft, which contained all manner of items, some old enough to be called vintage, which were carefully cataloged and ready to be selected when one day they were the exact solution to the problem at hand. When a grandchild needed the means to blow bubbles the size of a small car or a pair of wooden grass skis, or I was fretting about keeping my plants watered during my holiday, my dad had just the right thing. 

But my dad's actual superpower was his inclination towards the service of anyone and everyone who crossed his path, regardless of the personal cost. He was one of those rare individuals who you call when the crisis hits, knowing that he will not only know what to do, he's probably already done it whilst remaining calm and composed whilst everyone around is losing the plot.   
   
There's a girl in select town in Bangladesh who fractured her arm in 2008 just before Tim and I were visiting the house where her grandmother worked. I was shown the x-ray as soon as I arrived in the expectation the visiting UK doctor would have some opinion on what was quite a complex fracture which had not been managed brilliantly. 

But within 24 hours, thanks to a good internet connection, my dad had shown the x-ray to several of his colleagues at the orthopedic hospital in Oswestry, and she'd had expert advice most UK kids would not have received. 

My dad was all about a life of service. All superheroes know the importance of stamina in going the distance. My dad was often to be found driving us places, not just local lifts here and there, but cross country in all weathers, going wherever we needed him to take us, and our belongings, collect us, rescue us, visit us, whether it was driving or problem solving. 

If you asked my dad for help or advice, you could be sure he would still be working on it long after you, who had asked for his help in the first place, had given it up as a lost cause. 

But his real superpower was constancy. My dad knew the value of simple, non-flashy, persevering presence. He knew the truth, that it can often feel ordinary, but is actually extraordinary. I think he really knew that it was the superpower that our world needs more than anything else. 

At the end of the story, every superhero needs impeccable timing, and yet my dad died suddenly and unexpectedly. But I can say with certainty that he didn't die too soon. We will miss him hugely and need to acclimatise to a future without him, but God took him to be with himself at exactly the right time. 

We'll be apart for a season, but then we will get to spend eternity alongside him, face to face with Jesus. 
<br /><br />

*Revd Fi Iddon*  
Thank you. Louise and Neal, thank you so much for those words. 

Some words from 2 Corinthians chapter 3, which Judith has chosen. Some of you will recognize the scripture. Mike himself was our letter written on our hearts, known and read by everyone. He showed that he was “a letter from Christ written not with ink but with the spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on a tablet of human hearts. Now the Lord is spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom”. Mike was a letter from God written for each one of us to speak of God's amazing love. 

We're going to continue to reflect on that as we watch this photo tribute put together by the family. These are such special memories, the music of which reminds us of God's goodness and faithfulness.

Friends, those beautiful photos will be on again as we leave here today, but that whole photo tribute and with the music, particularly for those who are watching on a live stream for whom we have to mute pre-recorded music, is available on the page where the live stream is. So if you'd like to watch that again, that is available to us. 

We're going to stand and sing again now though. This is “Psalm 23”, the Lord's my Shepherd. Let's stand together.

*Revd Fi Iddon*  
Please do take a seat. 

Like many of you, I'm not sure how Mike found all the hours in the day that he did. And amazingly, he never ever seemed to be rushing. He always had time for us, didn't he? But we're going to hear now about some of the ways in which Mike made our lives all the richer, beginning with his working life. Thank you to Mike Davie.

# **Mike’s working life: RJAH Orthopaedic Hospital, Dr Mike Davie**  
Mike first came to the orthopaedic hospital in 1972 as a medical scientist in the radiology department. He helped to set up nuclear medicine scanning and became a vital cog in the setting up and running of the CT and MRI scanners. 

He recognised problems and provided solutions before others had even been aware of their existence. He did this in his quiet, unassuming, polite way that made his colleagues feel that he hid his light under a bushel. 

He was always aware of the patient being first. On one occasion, he obtained equipment to project images onto a wall to keep children amused and still during scanning. His politeness and consideration for others was instrumental in getting the best out of people. 

When scanners broke down, his marvellous relationship with the repairers got them rapidly on site, thus reducing downtime and limiting patient inconvenience. Mike's input extended into departments other than radiology. 

In the spinal injuries unit, urodynamic assessment is important in the management of their patients. Mike was an integral part of calibrating and fixing their equipment. In my department, the Charles Salt, he was actively involved in setting up a DEXA scanner to measure bone mass. That it became the busiest in the country was in no small part due to Mike. 

Mike was not only interested in hardware. He had a great interest in research and his knowledge of physics was invaluable in many projects. Looking through his publications reminded me how often he had helped the progress of doctors and others in their careers by engaging them in research projects. 

His involvement in the Charles Salt Unit was legendary. Students, PhDs and other staff benefited from his input. On one occasion, when I was getting over-enthusiastic in the interpretation of data, he pointed out in his gentle yet persuasive manner my “mild stretchings of the statistical method”. 

His work covered studies in CT, MRI, DEXA, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, body composition and fracture stiffness. Disorders as widespread as osteoporosis, Paget’s Disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, stroke and spinal injuries attracted his attention, leading to over 30 publications in respected journals. 

His retirement was a source of much anguish. Around the hospital, people were heard to whisper, “Mike's retiring. What are we going to do now?\!” But Mike still remained part of the hospital, helping at the help desk and assisting patients during Christmas Carol services. I was also honored to have him on the Committee of Research charity that I set up when I retired. 

I think I can do no better than end by quoting the sentiments that I have heard many say: one of nature's good guys. 
<br /><br />

*Revd Fi Iddon*  
Thank you so much, Mike. Well, as we've heard, Mike's involvement with the Orthopaedic really didn't end when his working life ended. And Victoria is going to share some of that with us now. 
<br /><br />

# **Mike’s continuing connections with the Orthopaedic: Victoria Sugden (League of Friends)**  
Hello. What an absolute privilege to stand here and share a few memories of our dear friend, Mike. 

I came to know Mike about 11 years ago as a newcomer to the hospital. He showed me extraordinary kindness, helping me to settle in with his encyclopedic knowledge and his gift for making people feel really welcome. 

As you know, Mike joined the hospital in 1972 as a clinical scientist in the x-ray department, and he gave four decades of service. But retirement never meant stepping away from the community that he loved. 

And in 2013, he returned as a volunteer for the League of Friends, first on the help desk, where his calm and approachable manner helped countless patients and visitors, and where his old colleagues loved to stop by for a chat. 

And who could blame them? There was something about his voice, distinctive, calm, with a twinkle of humor, that really made you feel like he was placing a warm arm around your shoulder. Almost everyone who passed the help desk was greeted by Mike by name, and I'm sure he knew 99% of the staff.   
   
How he remembered everybody I'll never know, but he really did know everyone and every place in the hospital. Some of the tributes that we've had by colleagues and friends capture him perfectly, and I just wanted to share them with you:  
“One of the nicest and kindest men, always had time to listen, a lovely man.”   
“Mike was one of the kindest and caring people you could meet”   
“I worked with him for many years, and he was always ready to listen if you needed any advice.”  
“Unfailingly generous with his time, and one of the kindest people I knew. A true gentleman.”   
“One of the people who embodied the RJH spirit.”   
I could go on…

For Mike, volunteering was about service and giving back. 

When the pandemic forced volunteers to stay home, he simply found another way of helping. He climbed onto his static bike, proudly wearing our hot pink shirt (we might've had to twist his arm a little bit for that one) and saying “the League of Friends needs our support more than ever and so I'm happy to get stuck in” and he raised an amazing 1,800 pounds. 

Warmth and kindness simply oozed from him so it was no surprise when he returned after Covid to join the chaplaincy team where his faith and gentle spirit brought comfort and hope to many. 

He became chair of the voluntary services committee giving even more time and wisdom. We in the league office benefited from his gentle advice and quiet suggestions. No pressure, just support. 

For me his kindness is summed up by small gestures. Years ago I confessed I couldn't keep a pot plant alive. Mike turned up with a Christmas cactus saying “you won't be able to do that”. It's still flowers every year on my kitchen windowsill, which will be a quiet reminder of him. 

Mike's life was full of service, faithful, generous and full of quiet humour too. He made our hospital and our lives better simply by being himself. 
<br /><br />

*Revd Fi Iddon*  
Thank you so much Victoria. Well, Mike's retirement was far from quiet as we've heard and Ali is going to share with us about Mike's work with the Food Hub. 
<br /><br />

# **Mike’s work with the Food Hub: Ali Thomas (Shrewsbury Food Hub)**  
Mike, our dear friend and a treasured member of Shrewsbury Food Hub. For those of you who don't know, we're a local charity that collects surplus food for social good. Back in 2016 Mike came to see me and Katie and said “I'd like to get involved, what can I do?” 

Soon after he started volunteering with us, Mike arranged a session here at Holy Trinity. He and I did a small presentation about the food hub upstairs in the Fawila Room. I think that's when Michael Carding and David Groves first started volunteering with us and it was the beginning of our long-standing relationship with HTMB. 

From the very beginning, Mike was a constant support to us. We never finished a meeting without him checking in, finding out how we really were personally. His wisdom and kindness embraced us all. We felt held and supported by his careful and considered oversight. 

Tony reminded us of how that kindness so often played out. He visited Tony many times in hospital, quietly being with him during a really really tough time. I remember when we first asked him to become a trustee back in 2020, he went quiet, and then he said, well, I'm very flattered, Ali, but I'm not sure I have much to offer. 

How wrong he was. He quickly became a fundamental part of our team. His kindness touched everyone he worked with. He really did care deeply about the people in Food Hub, as well as our mission. As Andrew Howe said, Mike was a welcome addition to the board of trustees. 

Mike took his role as a trustee very seriously, with great enthusiasm, commitment, and humility. He embodied the nurturing culture of the hub, always considering very carefully what impact our activities were having on others in the team. 

He was a great vice chair to Andrew. He provided close support to the board, both as a brilliant listener and when needed as an advisor. He offered friendship, encouragement, and wisdom, always with sensitivity and attention to detail. 

Practical, and with an eye for simplicity, he introduced effective ideas, particularly aimed at improving communications in the hub. He steered the development of our lovely newsletter, which is a vital tool that knits us together. He worked closely with Alison Ellis and Andrew Pech to produce excellent news items. 

Now, his understanding of the Food Hub was pretty unique. He collected food every Monday for eight years, so he knew the 7.30 to 9.30 mayhem very well indeed. He delivered food to our groups like Meadow Farm Preschool and Shrewsbury Academy. He managed the lovely team at the Foodshare in the Meet Place every Thursday. He was a trustee. He talked about the Food Hub at WIs, rotary clubs and gardening clubs up and down the county. 

He coordinated the Glean Team fruit harvest in August and September, and he and I spent many peaceful hours picking apples and watching butterflies. A few times, I'd bring one of my boys along if they happened to be home. We'd arrive at a location, and all you could see were Mike's legs up his trusty ladder. Daniel would whisper, “Mum, do you think Mike should be up there?” And I'd say, “Well, you can try and persuade him, but I don't fancy your chances.” 

He was a wonderful role model, and in his own quiet way helped those who worked with him try even harder to build a stronger, more caring community. We already miss him terribly. We can hear his voice. We keep expecting him to walk through the door at the hub, or to see him wave as he passed my house, or to see him and Judith walk through the quarry across that bridge. 

The hub itself will be okay, because it's a stronger, kinder and more resilient charity because of Mike's stewardship. 

He was a very special, selfless person, and I am deeply honoured to have been able to call in my friend. 
<br /><br />

*Revd Fi Iddon*  
Thank you so much, Ali. And Tim's going to come and share what many of us already know of what an amazing friend Mike was. 
<br /><br />

# **Mike as a friend: Tim Creyke**  
What an honour to be asked to speak about Mike as a friend, because we're all friends aren't we? And those of you taking part on the live stream, you're friends too and I want to tell you this church is packed out with friends. 

And it was a friend who sent me this quote which I want to use. It says, “The life of one so loved is never lost. Its influence lives on through all the lives it ever touched.” 

So let me rephrase that. “The life of Mike will never be lost because we remember how he touched our lives.” And I want to just remember a few ways that Mike touched my life. Right back in the beginning, 40 years ago, we came to Shrewsbury. We joined a babysitting circle and became friends with Mike and Judith. And one day they said to us, Why don't you try our church, Holy Trinity Meole Brace? So thank you, Judith and Mike, for this life-changing and life-enhancing introduction you gave us. 

At Holy Trinity, I saw Mike and Judith leading a young teenager's group, called the Pathfinders. They were on their own and I thought, well, they need some help. I was utterly ill-equipped, but I jumped in. 

I'm not sure the Pathfinders learnt anything from me, but I learnt a lot from them and from Mike and from Judith. And Judy and I remember a lot of fond memories at that time with youngsters, with Mike and Judith, with others, when we were doing all sorts of things together. 

We went to country walks, we climbed mountains. We did contribute some services when we went to Alton Towers. If you're looking for a memory, try and picture a gang of young teenagers pulling Mike onto the roller coaster at Alton Towers. 

There were plant fairs in the spring as well, Judith, I remember. Then our vicar, Harold Thornley, was ill and we asked to form prayer triplets. So Mike, Jack, Terry and I formed a triplet of four. And for the last 30 years, we've met to pray with Mike every Monday morning before breakfast. 

Mike, you're sorely missed, now we've got to learn to pray for the three. 

As many of you will know, Mike's kindness and influence was not always highly visible, it was not always noisy. Mike was not always in the foreground. 

But in the Trinity Centre work, he wasn't in the foreground, but his support was in the background. It was a great strength. He was a good friend, always interested, always encouraging, always praying, a vital role. 

He was, however, central to developing the Glebe Field work, first bringing it home to Holy Trinity, then leading the group trying to decide what we could do with it. This wasn't very easy. We floundered around in uncertainty for quite a long time. 

But Mike, I noticed, showed great care to listen to each person, to respect each person's views, and we gradually worked out a consensus of how to proceed. 

Finally, I do want to mention Mike's illness and his passing, where the trust in God shown by Mike and Judith is an inspiration. 

And so to me, and I know to all of you and you online, Mike has been a good friend and a good influence. He cared for so many people as we are hearing, he helped so many people as we're hearing. 

But that's what we all try to do, isn't it? 

Well, I think Mike's contribution was on a different scale. And the difference, I think, is that he did it. He delivered. He carried it through.   
He cared and he helped consistently.   
He cared and he helped thoughtfully.   
He cared and he thought thoroughly.  
 And he cared and he thought prayerfully. 

Mike's friendship was always reliable, always there when he needed it. That's why I think Mike's life lives on through all the lives he ever touched. 

So I say thank you, Mike, for being such a good friend and such a good influence.   
Mike, your friendship does live on. 
<br /><br />

*Revd Fi Iddon*  
Thank you so much, Tim. And finally, Kevin is going to share something of what Mike meant to us as the Trinity Church's family here. 
<br /><br />

# **Mike and Trinity Churches: Revd Kevin Roberts**  
Thank you, Fi. My immense privilege to pay tribute to Mike's contribution to the life of this church. And I have to say, his contribution was immense. And the impact that he made over 45 years here is, I think, incalculable. 

Indeed, it's hard to imagine, is it not, Trinity Church's without Mike amongst us. He did so much. How did Mike fit everything he did into his life? Because he did so much here at Trinity Churches. 

He was a PCC member for more years than anyone can count. He was twice church warden, and for a while he was vice chair of the PCC. And I gather from Judith that soon after Mike and Judith's arrival here in Shrewsbury, the then vicar of meal brace, Peter Ruffell, asked Mike to be the church treasurer, having heard that he'd done maths at A level. Vicars never miss a trick. 

Many young people, as you've just heard, hundreds maybe, will remember Mike as one of their Pathfinder leaders. He led home groups for countless years. He headed up the press circle until the end of his life, even emailing prayer requests for others from his hospital bed in the days before his death. 

As Tim has just said, he chaired the committee that led to the opening up of the Glebe Field to the wider community. And if there was a rota in church, then Mike has been on it, though apparently not coffee making. I'm not sure what the significance, Judith, of that is. 

And, of course, underlying all of this and foundational to Mike's life was his pattern with Judith, and in earlier years with Louise and Neal, of regular worship and active involvement in the life of our various congregations here at Trinity Churches. 

It literally makes me breathless to list all the many ways that Mike gave to the life of this church and I'm sure to have missed something along the way. It was extensive, it was impactful and I think I want to say Judith I think it was indelible. 

Mike has left a lasting mark upon the life of this place and upon the life of God's people here. 

But, friends, it wasn't just what Mike did, but it was the way that he did it and hasn't this come through in all of the tributes so far. 

Always done with kindness, always with humility, Mike never looking for prominence or particular recognition \- just wanting to serve. Always willing to get his hands dirty on the practical things \- the various churchyard working parties that we've had here over the years and such things. 

I was only one of four vicars of Meole Brace that Mike saw out. Phil Canesdale who is here today wrote to me, and I quote, of “Mike's deep character full of faith, his amazing humility, ever hopeful, always prayerful, a resilience which was remarkable”. 

Thank you Phil. These words I think are the measure of the man who we remember with such respect and such admiration. There are though just two further things that I need to say. Firstly, that who Mike was and what Mike did, all the many things that he did, was the overflow of his faith in Christ and his deep love for the Lord Jesus. 

It was Mike's living Christian faith that was the wellspring that inspired and informed every part of his life. A faith that was both prayerful and practical, that was both personal and communal, that was rooted in reality here and now, compassionately rooted in real life, but that constantly looked to a greater higher reality. 

That after years of seeing in a mirror dimly, he now sees (imagine that\!) face-to-face and, where as we mourn him and miss him here, Mike is fully alive today. 

But I can't finish without saying secondly that it was always through those 45 years “Mike and Judith” at Trinity Church. It was always Mike and you, Judith. 

Church was a together thing for you both. Faith was a journey and adventure that you took together. Mike did what he did and was who he was because it was always “Mike and Judith”. 

You alongside him, Judith, supporting him, praying for him, and cheering him on, and actually Mike doing all of that for you reciprocally. So we will miss Mike here at Trinity Churches more than we can say, but we can only imagine your even greater sense of loss for Judith, Neal, Louise, and the wider family. 

But let me say that this church, that Trinity Churches, that Mike's Church, and Judith, your church will be here for you on the onward journey as we make our way together to the greatest of all reunions and to the endless banquet feast of heaven.

Thank you so much, Kevin. There's so much more to say about Mike, isn't there, and all that he meant to each of us. We'll be able to remember Mike through our donations to the Food Hub and Trinity Churches as we leave here today. 

And there will as well, after this service, be an opportunity to share memories and to speak of Mike's enormous impact over some lovely refreshments in the Brabbury Hall, which is through the door at the back on your left. 

May I please ask a favour of current Trinity Church's family. Current Trinity Church's family, can we please model “family hold back” and wait in here to allow those people who do not have the privilege of seeing Judith every week to go first, so that she has time to spend with them as well. 

Thank you so much. Well, in a moment we're going to stand and sing again and this next song, “He Will Hold Me Fast”, is the only request that Mike had for this service, Judith. The words of this song meant so much to him as he faced that double cancer diagnosis. 

He faced it with deep honesty. I remember him saying to me just a few hours after being diagnosed, “I want to be authentic about this and how hard it is”. He faced that struggle with honesty, but with deep knowledge of the love and peace of Jesus, who held him fast. So let's stand and sing together “He will hold me fast”.

Please do take a seat as Phil comes to read scripture to us and then Nev is going to come and speak, thank you.

# **Reading: Romans 8:31-end**

*Revd Phil Cansdale*  
Let me read these words that come from the book of Romans chapter 8\.   
“What then shall we say in response to these things? 

If God is for us, who can be against us? For he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also along with him graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? 

It is God who justifies. Who then can condemn? No one. Christ Jesus who died more than that was raised to life, is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. So who shall separate us from the love of God? 

Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written, for your sake we face death all day long, we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 

For I'm convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. 

Amen.

# **Words of Christian Hope**

*Neville Willerton CA*  
Thank you. Good afternoon. I am deeply humbled and honoured to be asked to say a few words towards the end of our service of celebration of Mike and all that he brought to so many of us. We will all miss Mike hugely from Oswestry, from Shrewsbury from here the church at Trinity Churches. 

But I also want us to remember the hope that is within this reading that Phil has just read to us. The hope that was truly in Mike and embodied him. The kindness, the gentleness of Mike that we've heard about is a glimpse of the image of Christ within. 

I got to know Mike and Judith through coming along to this church. I was on the staff team about 20 years ago and I came to help with Pathfinder's, Tim, all those years ago. So, handing on a baton from one person to another, I tried to do the best that I could. 

My wife and I over those 20 years have often said we would love to be a little bit more like Mike and Judith. We have some way to go. We've always been drawn to them as a couple. Their faithful service, their care, and their boundless love for others. 

As we remember and we celebrate Mike's life, we recall his calm counsel and his faithful service of others. 

I've still heard over the past couple of weeks of him visiting people in hospital who were going through difficult and painful times. The little, but significant moments, not up in lights, little known, where he cared deeply for others. 

Reading from the book of Romans is a declaration of hope: “Even in difficult times, even in pain, even in the midst of death, there is this unshakable hope. Nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ. Nothing will separate us from God's love in Christ”. It was this hope, this love in Christ that we saw in Mike. 

We've heard so many words about Mike already within the service, how he gave himself to others in the hospital in Oswestry, the church community here, the Food Hub, his family, his neighbors and friends, and rightly so. 

It is because he knew that nothing could separate him from God's love in Christ that gave him the strength and the hope to love and serve others. He was able to serve and give away to others because he had an unshakable hope in Christ. 

Romans chapter 8 and verse 37 of our reading says that “we are more than conquerors through Him who is love”. Mike was and is more than a conqueror. It was the quiet, faithful, and consistent service of others that I and each of us have seen in Mike that reminds me that faith is real. 

Why? Because Mike knows Christ. I say ‘knows’ as opposed to ‘knew’ deliberately. An unshakable hope in the eternal. An unshakable hope in Christ. I would argue that it was this hope in Christ and how his life was shaped by Christ that drew each of us to him as a friend, drew each of us to Mike and to Judith as a couple. 

Mike was able to give himself so easily to work, to family, to church, to the Food Hub, to neighbors, to friends because he had this unshakable hope in Christ \- because he discovered Christ for himself. 

Our reading speaks about hardship, distress, persecution, pollution, pain, war, famine, nakedness, peril, and weapons. My goodness, in this fractured, polarized world, don't we need somebody who we cannot be separated from, somebody who is unchangeable and unshakable? 

In this broken world, don't we need somebody to hold us together? A God who loves us, who has a future for each of us. There is enough pain, there is enough anguish, there is enough loss and war in this world. 

But there is more that I want to draw from Romans chapter 8\. We need a hope in somebody who has been before us. We need a hope in somebody who has experienced pain, loss, and death. Somebody who has gone there before us. 

You see, I'm drawn to a God who gets beaten. I am drawn to a God who gets crucified. I am drawn to Christ, who shows us by his resurrection that there is hope in this world. He has gone ahead of us. I am drawn to a God who unites and builds bridges to this world. A God that shows this earthly life is not the end. 

Pain and loss, the tough experience of life, is not the end. There is nothing in this world that can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus. Mike and Judith have faced these past few years with dignity, a love for each other, and an unshakable hope in Christ. 

And so I think verse 37 of Romans 8 is entirely relevant and appropriate for a day like this, for Mike and for Judith, that they are more than conquerors through him who loves us. Here is a life in Mike that was modeled on Christ as Mike preferred others, as Mike loved others and served others. 

He was modeling the life of Christ who he followed. So bear with me as I change the reading slightly. Let me put it like this: “Know, in all these things, Mike was more than a conqueror through Christ who loves him”. 

For I am convinced that nothing, not even death, will be able to separate Mike from the love of God in Christ Jesus. And so we pray for Judith, for Neal, for Louise and the family. May they know the love of Christ, giving them strength. 

May they know that nothing in life, not even death, can separate us from Him who is love. Today we give thanks for the life of Mike, for how he gave himself to others, for the faith that sustained him, and how we touch so many lives that are gathered here and watching on screen, with his wisdom, his love, his grace, and his faith. 

May each of us continue to be inspired and drawn to this Christ that gave Mike hope. Amen.

*Rev Fi Iddon*  
Amen. Thank you so much, Neve. We're going to pray together now, as Charles leads us. 
<br /><br />

# **Prayers**

*Revd Charles Ruxton*  
Thank you. Mike had a way with people. 

I wish we could learn it too. We've talked of Mike and of God, and we've sung our songs. Now let's engage before we finish in conversation with Almighty God. And as we come to pray, even in our grief, the first thought that comes to us is of thankfulness. 

There have been countless times over the years when we've had cause to thank Mike, but now is His life on this planet earth is wrapped up and we look back over it a fountain of thankfulness erupts from us how grateful we are. Thank you, Mike, and thank you, God. Thank you God for thinking him up in the first place \- fearfully and wonderfully making him in his mother's womb for his first baby steps for his childhood, loved and growing in you. Thank you, God for making yourself known to him as a teenager and for his reception of you, that you and he became friends. Thank you for his time at college. Thank you for when he met Judith and the love that blossomed between them. Thank you for growing in him his caring nature and his technical skills and in Judith too, so you made them such a good match, such a perfect team. Thank you for the joy of Louise and Neal as they came along and that family that grew in you. 

Thank you for planting Mike in RJAH, a place where he could use his gifts, a place where he was part of that community but made that community what it was too. And thank you for using those gifts even in his retirement and blessing many through him. 

Thank you for sending Mike and Judith to this church for the care that they gave to young people, for their pastoral care so quietly given has been spoken about so much in this church today. And thank you, God, for inviting Mike into your operation room where you plan and work your goodness in this world. Lord, you invite us all there but Mike went right in there and spent so much time with you. What a joy it was to him.

 Thank you for his prayers that doubtless go on even now. Thank you that even in illness he knew that you were there for him, for his quiet trust the result of a lifelong knowledge of you, for the knowledge that even a life-threatening illness could never separate him from you. 

Thank you that the details even of his dying were marked by your hand. Thank you. 

But Lord, his going leaves us bereft. He was a brick, nay a rock in the walls of our lives, leaving a hole that none of us can just walk into and fit into. 

Lord, will you teach us how to take our place in the wall? Will you teach us how to learn from what Mike taught us? And will you bless each of the groups of people who are left without him? 

We pray for RJAH. We thank you and pray that the stream of people that leaves that place, leaving their crutches and slings behind, would continue and grow. We pray that the machinery would keep working, we pray that that community of teams that make that hospital the place it is would continue in the spirit that Mike so fostered. 

We pray for the Food Hub that that too would be a community of hope, feeding many. And we pray, too, that the day would come when its work would be ended and there would be nobody left hungry in this land and in this world. Lord the second biggest hole is here at church where Mike's care and Mike's prayerfulness sustained us and we're indeed a rock in the building of this place. Lord, teach us to do what he did. 

And the biggest hole is among those who loved him longest, especially his family. And we pray for Louise and Tim for Nathan and Freya we pray for Neal. We pray for Mike's sisters, Kim and Jan. We pray for David's family. And Lord we pray for Judith. 

Comfort them and strengthen them in this time. Teach them the value of their inheritance that they have from Mike. Lord, you are tender towards your children and your mercy is over all your works. Will you heal memories of hurt and failure? 

For past mistakes, times when things haven't gone right, Lord, you heal it all now. As you've healed Mike in death, so heal us in our loss. And so now, we end our prayers in praise. As Mike's eyes were always on you, and as they see you clearly now, so we too raise high your name. 

You are awesome, you are mighty, and yet you invite us into your friendship. You are wise, you are beautiful, and yet you choose to share that with us. And you are good, and when we draw near, our failings fall away. 

So to you, Lord, be glory, and majesty, and dominion, and power, for ever. Amen. 

And so let's join together in the words that Jesus taught us to pray with. 
<br /><br />

# **The Lord’s Prayer**

Our Father in heaven,   
hallowed be your name.   
your kingdom come,   
your will be done,   
on earth as in heaven.   
Give us today our daily bread.   
Forgive us our sins   
as we forgive those who sin against us.   
Lead us not into temptation,   
but deliver us from evil.   
For the kingdom, the power,   
and the glory are yours,   
now and forever.   
Amen.
<br /><br />

*Revd Fi Iddon*  
Thank you Charles. In a moment I'm going to say a final blessing and then we're going to sing “Thine Be the Glory” which is the formal end of this service before we head through into the Bradbury Hall and we're singing these words in sure and certain hope and knowledge that Mike is now with Jesus. 

Mike's faith was intrinsic to who he was. We've heard that so many times today, haven't we? It's what Jesus has done for Mike and for each of us that allowed Mike to be who he was to each of us. So as this hymn ends, as “Thine Be the Glory” ends, there's an opportunity to give thanks however you feel appropriate and the family have asked that if you want to show your support and appreciation with God, clapping as an outlet of joy and thanks, then that would be wonderful. And in doing so, we will be echoing the greeting that Mike will have received when he reached heaven. “Well done, good servant, and welcome home”. 

Friends, would you please stand? 
<br /><br />

# **Blessing**

And before we sing these amazing words of Easter Hope, let me pray for us. May the God of Hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in Him, so that you might overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. 

# 

And the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be among you and remain with you and with all those you love and pray for, this day and forevermore, Amen. Let's sing together. 
<br /><br />

# **Hymn: Thine be the Glory**

Close.
